# EXPERIMENT LOG — append-only

Falsification criteria are logged BEFORE an experiment starts. Verdicts cite
evidence paths. Two-benchmark minimum for measurement verdicts.

## 2026-06-12 — PROGRAM INIT

- Program files created. Champion = b79e82dd (`ckpt_iter_1500.pt`,
  k200_real_ante). Gate battery + attacker baselines recovered from
  `evals/c3_gate_20260611_pergame/` and
  `evals/attacker_ext_20260611_pergame/attacker_ext_20260611/REPORT.md`;
  tabulated in PROGRAM.md.
- Finding: no on-disk spec existed for the commitment-scaled tail floor (only
  the approved CAN-RIDE line, SESSION_LOG 2026-06-11 + tail-accounting
  evidence). Spec reconstructed and frozen at `H1_TAIL_FLOOR_SPEC.md`.
- Environment: live dry-run ACTIVE (run_live_dryrun.py since 04:20,
  `logs/live_dryrun_20260612_042058.jsonl`, Stage-2 flags armed) ⇒ all >30min
  evals (H1 TG3/TG4) DEFERRED until it ends.

## 2026-06-12 — H1 TAIL FLOOR — falsification criteria (PRE-COMMITTED, before build)

Estimated cost: build+TG1+TG2 ≈ 4–6 h now; TG3 ≈ 4–8 h CPU deferred;
TG4 ≈ 6–10 h CPU deferred (measurement-only, reuses trained attackers).

- **F-TG1:** any behavioral diff with flag OFF across ALL raw-record dry-run
  logs ⇒ implementation rejected (fix or abandon; gate not weakened).
- **F-TG2:** (a) the session-1 seq-315 7.5% ALLIN tail must be caught at
  τ_max ∈ {0.10, 0.15}; (b) zero argmax changes at any τ; (c) altered-decision
  rate at τ_max=0.10 ≤ 5% of decision frames. Any failure ⇒ STOP before TG3.
- **F-TG3 (ship bar):** paired all-games delta z > −2 AND diverged-games
  per-firing delta > 0 with z ≥ 2, at the single τ_max fixed by TG2 BEFORE
  launch. No EV gain ⇒ does not ship. No seed re-rolls, no post-hoc τ shopping.
- **F-TG4:** extraction with tail floor armed worse than champion B4/B5
  floors-ON baselines by > 2σ ⇒ kill regardless of TG3.

Status: build starting (implementation subagent). Verdict: pending.

## 2026-06-12 — H3 OPPONENT-DATA PIPELINE — start

Estimated cost: 3–5 h build. Not an EV experiment — falsification n/a;
acceptance = extractor round-trips ALL existing live session logs with hand /
action / showdown counts that reconcile against the audited postmortems
(session-1: 37 hands / 61 decision frames is the known cross-check), ingest
command is idempotent (re-ingesting a session does not duplicate rows), and
the field-stats report runs. H4 unlock counter = opponent-observed hands
(hands with ≥1 non-hero action observed), threshold ≥ 500.

Status: build starting (background subagent). Verdict: pending.
